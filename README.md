# Gale-Shapley Algorithm (With slight modification to include additional features)

Simple and easy to understand implementation of Gale-Shapley Algorithm in Python.

Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to find a stable matching between 2 entities. More can be found here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem

The code takes an example where there are 5000 students and 15 colleges. Each college has between 30-40 seats. The preferences of students 
are assigned randomly and the preferences of the colleges are assigned randomly as well.

The output shows a stable matching according to the preferences of both student and college where the student proposes and the college
accepts or rejects.

The code can be modified to input these values from a csv, or even user input.
